# [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## Problems:
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.<br>

### Example 1:
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4] <br>
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4] <br>

### Example 2:
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [] <br>
Output: [] <br>

### Example 3:
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0] <br>
Output: [0] <br>

### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
