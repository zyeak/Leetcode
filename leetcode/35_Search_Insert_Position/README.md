# [35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

## Problems:
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. <br>

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.<br>

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5 <br>
Output: 2 <br>

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0 <br>
Output: 0 <br>

### Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0 <br>
Output: 0 <br>

### Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
* nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
* -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
