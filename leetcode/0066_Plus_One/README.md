# [66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

## Problems:
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's. <br>

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits. <br>

### Example 1:
Input: digits = [1,2,3] <br>
Output: [1,2,4] <br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123. <br>
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124. <br>
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4]. <br>

### Example 2:
Input: digits = [0] <br>
Output: [1] <br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 0. <br>
Incrementing by one gives 0 + 1 = 1. <br>
Thus, the result should be [1]. <br>

### Example 3:
Input: digits = [9] <br>
Output: [1,0] <br>
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9. <br>
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10. <br>
Thus, the result should be [1,0]. <br>

### Constraints:
* 1 <= digits.length <= 100
* 0 <= digits[i] <= 9
* digits does not contain any leading 0's.
