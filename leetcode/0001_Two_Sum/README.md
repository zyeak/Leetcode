# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Problems:

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.<br>

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. <br>

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 <br>
Output: [0,1] <br>
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. <br>


### Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 <br>
Output: [1,2] <br>


### Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6 <br>
Output: [0,1] <br>
