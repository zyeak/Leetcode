# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

## Problems:
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.<br>

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.<br>

### Example 1:
Input: x = 121 <br>
Output: true <br>

### Example 2:
Input: x = -121 <br>
Output: false <br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>

### Example 3:
Input: x = 10 <br>
Output: false <br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. 
Therefore it is not a palindrome. <br>

### Example 4:
Input: x = -101 <br>
Output: false <br>
