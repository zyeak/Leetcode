# [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

## Problems:
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.<br>

Return the sum of the three integers. <br>

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. <br>

 

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1 <br>
Output: 2 <br>
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2). <br>

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1 <br>
Output: 0 <br>


### Constraints:
* 3 <= nums.length <= 1000
* -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
* -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
